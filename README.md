# What I intended to create:

# I created a funny meme that shows a group of people lying on the ground. I added the text to make it look like theyâ€™re doing contemporary dance but ended up looking sleepy.

# Theme:

# The theme is about how hard dance can be. The caption makes fun of how dance can sometimes be so tiring that you just need to rest. It is also in Filipino to make it more relatable.
